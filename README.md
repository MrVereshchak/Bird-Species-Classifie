# Bird Species Classifier ðŸš€

This project provides a **Bird Species Classifier** for birds commonly found in Ohio. The model is trained on **Kaggle** using FastAI and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** with Gradio for easy image classification.

---

## How It Works
1. **Model Training**: Performed on Kaggle using the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Web App**: Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with a Gradio interface for classification. The link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/darii-ukrop/ohio_bird_classifier
